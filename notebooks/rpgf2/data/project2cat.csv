"Ed25519 in Web Browsers (WebTransitions.org)","Ed25519 curves are used by libp2p, IPFS, Filecoin, UCANs, Web3.storage/Storacha and many cryptocurrencies for high performance cryptographic signing operations. After more than 3 years of effort, Web Crypto API support for Ed25519 is now implemented in all major browsers. Dietrich Ayala created https://webtransitions.org to work on web browser/standards support for technologies used in Filecoin and its stack, and volunteered for nearly 2yrs to get Ed25519 shipped on the web.","https://webtransitions.org","The status quo requires any dapp or web page at all which uses Ed25519 curves to bundle their own implementation. These implementations can be sizeable, leading to poor web performance. Also, the implementations are not necessarily audited, especially to the standard of the cryptography libraries shipped in industrial-strength web engines like Chromium, Webkit and Gecko. So providing native support reduces the surface area for something to go wrong from a security standpoint. This not only true for the IPFS/libp2p/Filecoin stacks, but the many cryptocurrencies which use this curve, and every other non-crypto usage of it as well. Web browser support for Ed25519 means every page loaded for every dapp that uses this curve will load faster and can be more secure out of the box.","Confirmed will adopt:

- js-libp2p (and everything which uses it - eg Helia)
- Storacha
- Metamask will migrate to it in their browser extensions
- UCAN spec recommends Ed25519, so future impls will likely use this where UCANs are used on the web

Even once a feature is available on all three engines, it takes quite some time for the availability of the feature to reach a threshold where developers can take advantage of it, since older browsers remain in the market for so long.

"Funding the Commons","Funding the Commons is dedicated to advancing blockchain-based infrastructure for public goods funding. Through a series of global conferences, hackathons, residencies, and public goods experiments, we unite innovators from Web2, Web3, academia, public institutions, philanthropy, and industry. Our mission is to drive community-led governance and systemic change in public goods management, creating scalable solutions supported by continuous funding and robust impact evaluation.","http://fundingthecommons.io/","With 11 international conferences since its inauguration in 2021, Funding the Commons is a referential event series across strategic markets for PGF innovation. FtC has also been organizing successful builder residencies, numerous public goods funding hackathons, as well select impact pilot projects leveraging the tools platformed across its ecosystem. 
Within the web3 ecosystem, FtC has established itself as the premier conference for PFG advancements, specifically targeting builders and innovators within the Filecoin and IPFS networks. 

By providing a platform for these individuals to showcase their work and connect with public goods funders, FtC has been instrumental in fostering collaborations and bringing to light the contributions of the Filecoin community to a broader audience. This initiative has bridged the gap between Filecoin and the wider public goods funding ecosystem, encompassing both web3 and web2 spaces, thereby facilitating an environment where ideas and methodologies for sustaining open-source projects can flourish and evolve. 

This was more evident than ever before with our 10th conference that took place in Tokyo July 2024. Indeed, this event marks the continuation of our community building initiatives in Asia (Taipei 2023 being the first + our Chiang Mai residency the second), and we are now in the process of producing 3 additional events in Bangkok in the coming week ([IRL Hackathon,](https://lu.ma/ftc-ec-hackathon) [De](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/ftc-2024/detail)[sign Jam](https://lu.ma/designjam-bangkok), [our flagship FtC conference](https://lu.ma/ftc-bangkok-2024) (~ total of 750 attendees expected across all events).

We are seeing a very tangible interest from local governments, academic, media sources, as well as international groups like UNICEF’s Office of Innovation, in our ability to spotlighting real-world use-cases that can be used as fuel for policy advocacy. With FtC Tokyo, we successfully invited public sector leaders to participating in our event programming - including [Tokyo Governor of Yuriko Koike](https://x.com/FundingCommons/status/1815925061762548182), [Mr. Masaaki Taira (member of the House of Representatives and leading regulator of web3 and AI in Japan](https://x.com/TAIRAMASAAKI/status/1815992116537090457), who participated in a panel with our CEO), and [Audrey Tang, former Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan](https://x.com/audreyt).

Tokyo was also a testament to our ability to entrust local teams to lead the curation process, as well as collaborate on event production. Over the course of many months, we partnered closely with [DeSci Tokyo,](https://desci-tokyo.jp/) [Plurality Tokyo,](https://plurality.tokyo/) [Fracton Ventures,](https://fracton.ventures/en/about/) [Code for Japan,](https://t.co/RaFXQfvi9Y) [Mitsubachi](https://100banch.com/projects/MitsubachiDAO) to bring this event to life. **Total attendees: 538. Recap video:** https://x.com/FundingCommons/status/1850842192455065649

Through our IRL and virtual events, hackathons, residencies, and public goods funding experiments, we connect builders and residents to the Filecoin ecosystem, fostering direct collaboration and innovation in decentralized technologies for public goods.

Since 2024, Funding the Commons has inherited Sustainable Blockchain Summit (SBS) and is now building on the legacy of this second conference series focused on exploring new models & mechanisms to better steward planetary commons through [Earth Commons](https://www.commons.earth/).

In Zurich, we hosted a private dinner bringing together the climate finance world. Multiple Filecoin & IPFS builders participants attended, including Alan Ransil from Devonian Systems, David Dao from GainForest, and Frederic Fournier from Open Forest Protocol. These builders had the opportunity to connect with diverse players from the Swiss Central Bank, the Swiss climate venture and private equity ecosystem, a member of the board of the International Monetary Fund, as well as with multiple representatives from family offices around the country.

            - Prajjawal Khandelwal: [Adafel](https://demo.adafel.com/). [Github](https://github.com/Prajjawalk).
            - James Farrell: [Akashic](https://github.com/fundingthecommons/akashic). [Github](https://github.com/positonic).
            - Shyam Sridhar. [Github](https://github.com/SridharShyam).
    
    Additionally, progress on the Akashic project marks a significant milestone in Funding the Commons' efforts. This ambitious project aims to construct a digital archive of refugee stories on IPFS and Filecoin, safeguarding the memories, stories, and cultural heritage of refugees worldwide. Akashic's use of the decentralized and censorship-resistant properties of IPFS and Filecoin perfectly aligns with Filecoin's mission to offer a durable base for the preservation of human knowledge and history, ensuring these narratives remain immutable, accessible, and free from central oversight.
    
    During the residency, multiple residents contributed to the Akashic project, while coordinating closely with [Kickstarter’s crowdfunding protocol](http://kickstarter.com/protocol/) team to cement the partnership and accelerate the development of the platform and integration of Kickstarter’s crypto stack.
    
    Moreover, Akashic was benefited by the presence of the technical leads from [Refunite](https://www.notion.so/576a4348d9ff48ef90d7462eb43b237b?pvs=21) and [Holonym](https://www.notion.so/107490db0c358085abc3f86825e49958?pvs=21). Refunite is a platform that helps reunite lost families, comprising of over 1 million registered users, and reaching 100 million+ individuals across Africa, many without government-registered ID’s. Holonym is a digital identity protocol. The three teams worked together to prototype a digital identity system for refugees and stateless persons, which will be an essential component for Akashic to practically serve its user base, a large percentage of whom cannot pass traditional KYC. This digital identity system would enable refugee creators to have an immutable identity, which can be linked to both crypto wallets and media stored on Filecoin.
    
    Lastly, as part of the ongoing hackathon, Funding the Commons subsidized an Akashic-related bounty posted by Numbers Protocol in order to incentivize more builder participation in creating an immutable archive of refugee-created media.

    - A pivotal aspect of Funding the Commons' dedication to supporting public goods builders is the creation of the [Builder Basic Income Fund on Drips](https://www.drips.network/app/drip-lists/36167722434539895740687283110259945938004377627588501179309095983175). This initiative serves as a concrete mechanism to offer continuous financial support to developers, allowing them to concentrate on adding value within open-source ecosystems without the burden of financial uncertainty. By ensuring a steady income for builders, Funding the Commons not only aids individual creators but also sets a new standard for public goods funding, encouraging other entities to adopt similar supportive measures. Funding the Commons currently supports three builders on this Drips list, all of whom are alumni of our residency. Drips has matched Funding the Commons 1:1 to boost Builder Basic Income.

    - Sustainable Blockchain Summit —> Launch of Earth Commons
        - [2024 programming & updates](https://www.notion.so/Earth-Commons-2024-Update-bf583895082446229dab3c05309581be?pvs=21)

Additionally, progress on the Akashic project marks a significant milestone in Funding the Commons' efforts. This ambitious project aims to construct a digital archive of refugee stories on IPFS and Filecoin, safeguarding the memories, stories, and cultural heritage of refugees worldwide. Akashic's use of the decentralized and censorship-resistant properties of IPFS and Filecoin perfectly aligns with Filecoin's mission to offer a durable base for the preservation of human knowledge and history, ensuring these narratives remain immutable, accessible, and free from central oversight.

During the residency, multiple residents contributed to the Akashic project, while coordinating closely with [Kickstarter’s crowdfunding protocol](http://kickstarter.com/protocol/) team to cement the partnership and accelerate the development of the platform and integration of Kickstarter’s crypto stack.

Moreover, Akashic was benefited by the presence of the technical leads from [Refunite](https://www.notion.so/576a4348d9ff48ef90d7462eb43b237b?pvs=21) and [Holonym](https://www.notion.so/107490db0c358085abc3f86825e49958?pvs=21). Refunite is a platform that helps reunite lost families, comprising of over 1 million registered users, and reaching 100 million+ individuals across Africa, many without government-registered ID’s. Holonym is a digital identity protocol. The three teams worked together to prototype a digital identity system for refugees and stateless persons, which will be an essential component for Akashic to practically serve its user base, a large percentage of whom cannot pass traditional KYC. This digital identity system would enable refugee creators to have an immutable identity, which can be linked to both crypto wallets and media stored on Filecoin.

Lastly, as part of the ongoing hackathon, Funding the Commons subsidized an Akashic-related bounty posted by Numbers Protocol in order to incentivize more builder participation in creating an immutable archive of refugee-created media.

"Storage Onboarding R&D","Research and implementation work for improving the sector-onboarding pipeline. In particular, we shipped three FIPs:

- **Synthetic PoRep**: A new PoRep type with smaller storage overhead between PreCommit and ProveCommit;
- **NI-PoRep**: A new PoRep type that removes on-chain interaction and represents the first step to make Sealing-as-a-Service possible;
- **Remove PreCommitSectors**: Remove ProveCommitSector in favor of ProveCommitSectors3 and ProveCommitAggregate to resolve the imbalanced cost of sector activation using different onboarding methods and make proof aggregation financially sensible again.
","https://www.filoz.org","The *Storage Onboarding R&D* project benefits Storage Providers (SPs) by streamlining and reducing costs in the onboarding pipeline, helping them operate more efficiently and economically.

Our project tackles key issues such as memory inefficiency during PoRep, limited flexibility for SPs, and the lack of a viable Sealing-as-a-Service model. In particular, 
  - *Synthetic PoRep*: 
    - Reduced the size of the temporary data stored between PreCommit and ProveCommit (150 epochs) from ~400GiB to ~25GiB, with no impact on security.
  - *NI-PoRep*: 
    - Simplified storage onboarding pipeline (no precommit step, no waiting time, no precommit deposit);
    - Trustless separation between storage and computing: the proving tasks associated with sector onboarding can be outsourced;
    - Unblocking [SupraSeal](https://github.com/supranational/supra_seal)'s full potential.
  - *Removal of PreCommitSectors*: 
    - Reduced block cron time by 10x;

"NFT.Storage - Long-Term Storage Flagship Product","NFT.Storage’s mission is ""to preserve all NFTs as timeless assets,"" providing a public good for long-term off-chain NFT storage. Our flagship product offers low-cost, verifiable NFT preservation, using Filecoin as a reliable backup to hot storage. Backed by an on-chain endowment and powered by RaaS smart contracts, we aim to ensure ongoing accessibility for off-chain NFT data, with intentionally low costs to make preservation accessible to everyone.","https://nft.storage","Roughly 90% of NFTs store their artwork and metadata off-chain, relying on centralized servers or IPFS—yet neither option is permanent. In 2023, nearly 1/3 of NFTs become inaccessible due to unreliable storage solutions, the highest number of all previous years. 

NFT.Storage is essential for NFT creators, marketplaces, collectors, and platforms to ensure their NFTs don’t “die.” 

NFT.Storage addresses this risk with a decentralized, endowment-backed solution, providing a robust safeguard against data loss. Using IPFS for content addressing and Filecoin’s decentralized storage network, NFT.Storage aims to ensure that NFTs remain secure and accessible over time. Our on-chain endowment and storage managed programmatically with FEVM's RaaS, continuously manages storage deals and will programmatically funds storage providers, keeping assets verifiable and retrievable for the long term.

Unlike other storage options, NFT.Storage is a public good. While alternative solutions offer permanent storage, their costs are often prohibitive for most NFT projects. NFT.Storage stands out as the only viable, cost-effective option for long-term NFT preservation at scale. By providing affordable and sustainable storage, we enable creators and platforms to securely back up their off-chain data without the high expenses associated with permanent storage solutions.

In the future, we plan to launch the NFT Storage Checker, a tool that will allow block explorers, marketplaces, and wallets to verify the long-term storage status of NFTs. This tool will display verification badges on NFTs, boosting user confidence in the durability and security of digital assets. Platforms can seamlessly integrate the NFT Storage Checker, displaying badges on NFTs stored with NFT.Storage. Users can click these badges to view detailed information about the NFT’s storage conditions, enhancing transparency and trust. The NFT Storage Checker will help platforms showcase NFT reliability while generating revenue to support NFT.Storage’s operational costs. This tool reinforces our mission to provide accessible, long-term storage and peace of mind for the entire NFT ecosystem.","**Case studies about projects using the product, co-written with the community:**

"Prolly Tree Indexed Data Oracle for IPLD","A Prolly Tree is a search tree where the number of values stored in each node is determined probabilistically, based on the data which is stored in the tree.

We introduce the indexing technology of Prolly trees into the IPLD data format and build：
1. the golang implementation of probabilistic merkle search trees for IPLD as a library,
2. the ipld prolly trees indexer based on this library,One note, our indexing is a separate thing from prolly trees. Prolly trees give us a B+ tree alternative that's content addresssible and determenistic, on top of that we created a document-oriented database engine with collections and indexes.
3. the data oracle on Blockchain to interact the IPLD dataset through the indexer.

","https://dataoracle.gitdata.ai","Peer to peer and decentralized applications have been popular lately, but almost all of them rely on synchronizing append only logs of operations (or an equivalent). This leads to performance degredation over time as data accumulates and needs to be processed on new peers before they can start querying and updating data within an existing swarm. This project deals with how pre-indexed peer to peer databases can be built and how they can sidestep the need to process operation logs and query data more efficiently. The short of it is that with this new data structure, the network becomes your database instead of needing to build a database after loading everything from the network.

Most existing p2p databases like OrbitDB, SecureScuttlebutt, Automerge, or Cabal work by having each users create a log of all the changes they're making to a dataset. Each change that needs to happen or new piece of data that gets created is stored in an ""operation"" in the users log. When a peer wants to load data they will start pulling changes out of the logs of other peers and processing them locally in order to arrive to the latest ""state"" of the dataset. What's interesting is this isn't just the case of p2p databaes, but is also the building block of distributed databases in general like MongoDB or CockroachDB. In fact, most blockchains are just another case of databases that make use of append only operation logs, but with new ways of doing log consistency which distributes trust accross minors or validators. At the end of the day it's all operation logs and some sort of mechanism for ensureing the consistency of the log and whether the DB can process operations in different orders to arrive at the same state.

This setup works well in that it separates the view of the data from how the data gets replicated and leaves a lot of room for how to manage consistency and fault tolerance in your system. However, this setup works best for databases that are always online and have a relatively consistant set of peers to replicate to. If you have large time ranges where two peers are unable to communicate, or if you have new peers joining and leaving, you end up requiring large amounts of operationst to be processed before a peer can actually make use of the data.

This can be see in in scenarios where somebody is following a lot of users with a lot of history in SSB and needing to wait for all the logs to be processed, or when a new database replica is added and needs to fetch all the existing state (whether it's a regular DB or a blockchain full node). The new node will need to sit still and focus all of its resources on catching up with the append only log and updating it's local database indexes before it's able to do antyhing else. Relying on append only logs leads to this scenario as your data grows and as the number of peers trying to consume the data grows and leads to similar situations accross all systems with this core building block. You can attempt to optimize your core sync logic but as your data grows in either volume or frequency, you'll end up facing the same limitations.

One way to get around needing to ""catch up"" with a writer is to get ""snapshots"" of the current state of the data from trusted peers. From there you can skip a lot of the extra processing and just load the new changes since your snapshot. This of course presumes that you have a trusted peer and that they are in fact trustworthy, which isn't always possible in distributed systems (in particular p2p). In some cases the snapshot might not be getting generated in time or might be so large that auditing it becomes infeasible.

Another approach is to split your data into multiple oplogs for different ""regions"" so that peers only need to replicate the data that is actually relevant to them. This is used by certain databases like CockroachDB, by the ""offchain"" processing methods we're seeing in some cryptocurrency projects, and by projects like PeerBit which split up the logs for individual documents. The Secure Scuttlebutt community is also looking at a new feed standard where they can split up users data into a bunch of sparsely replicated feeds. Splitting up the logs can reduce the overall amount of operations you need to replicate, but for bits of data that have a lot of ""history"", you can expect to see everything getting slower and slower as time progrsses. For exaple if you have a chat room with a multi-year history, if a new user needs to rely on append only logs to get the latest data, they'll have no choice but to sit there while it loads.

All of this together leads to either a centralization of power in long-lived nodes that do the replication for you (e.g. traditional databases, blockchains) and then give you access to the data as a ""client"" which needs to rely on the node to be truthful and constantly reachable. For cases where an application doesn't have the ability to do this centralization (like p2p databases), you end up getting performance degrdation as your data grows.

Similar to B+ Trees, prolly trees store ordered key ranges in a tree structure. Unlike B+ Trees they use content addressibility and probibalistic chunking to determenistically generate the tree structure. In practice this means that the same key-value pairs will generate the same tree structure regardless of insertion order and one can combine two trees determenistically.

Everything that can apply to B+ Trees and database indexes, can now apply to Prolly Trees with the added ability of it being p2p, sparsely loaded, and mergable. In particular, when merging two datasets, you can easily skip over blocks that are the same on both sides without having to traverse into a tree, you can also insert entire ranges that are new into your tree withut having to fully traverse the individual items within.

Use Cases1: P2P Social Apps. A lot of social P2P apps right now use the append only logs method of synchronizing data and end up having large histories if they actually get used for a long period of time. Generally these apps also have users coming in and out from the swarm frequently and being offline for long periods of time. This leads users to commonly face the downsides of using append only logs. New users have to sit and wait for their databases to sync (sometimes for minutes, sometimes tens of minutes), and users that haven't been online for a while can still need to sit around a bit to get up to speed. Very active users that might be in a bunch of chatrooms at once will have that initial load multiplied by each chat they're participating in which can lead to sluggishness (see Matrix chat clients when you're in hundreds of rooms with thousands of people).

If these apps instead used prolly tree based p2p databases, they could drastically improve the initial load times.


Use Cases2: Blockchain State. Most ""clients"" trying to use blockchains have to trust that the full node they're using isn't omitting data, and that it will be online fot them indefinitely. These full nodes typically keep a local database (like postgres or the such) and have an HTTP API for clients to connect to and ask for state. This HTTP API is where full nodes can impose arbitrary restrictions and start charing for access to the chain state. For example, if you're trying to use metamask to access some data, or some NFT platform, they effectively control your access to the chain via their centralized management of these HTTP APIs.

With prolly tree based p2p databases, we can sidestep the need for these HTTP APIs and central-ish databases in blockchain ecosystems. Instead of a blockchain existing to keep an append only log of blocks, and full nodes acting as indexers over that state in order to make it actually usable, what if the chain published both the latest block, and a link to the root of a Prolly Tree containing the indexes of all the data.

From there a client could talk to any node participating in keeping the chain running and do their actual query on the data by traversing the peer to peer indexes. Instead of loading everything from a single node and depending on it to be online, a client can load subsets of the index from multiple nodes in paralell, and the more nodes exist in the chain the more available the data will be.

This can also be used to ""prove"" that a certain result was part of the blockchain state by linking to the root block, and the subset of the prolly tree which was used to satisfy the query. From there one could send these proofs around to different systems which can have implications for inter-chain communication and sending proofs without needing to be fully connected to the chain.

Backups and fresh starts can also be improved in that a node can get the latest block from the chain and start loading the underlying prolly trees from the history while prioritizing blocks that are relevant to any smart contract calculations first. To be specific, a node can execute code that relies on the state before having a full copy of the state by being able to load the part of the prolly tree it needs on the fly from the rest of the network.

Storage of the blockchain state can also be optimized thanks to the content addressibility. If only a small subset of the index changed, then all the other nodes in the tree will remain the same. It's kind of like compressing your DB right from the get go without losing the ability to roll back to earlier snapshots of your state.


Use Cases3: Cross-Organizational Search. Another place where p2p search indexes would be useful is for indexing institutional data for text search. Specifically, it could be useful for projects doing archiving of data using WebRecorder to build up large datasets of crawled data. At the moment, it's possible to index data from these sources using traditional centralized databases like Elasticsearch, but this requires running centralized infrastructure and doesn't allow for sharing indexes between groups easily. Often this is done via external companies like Google which come in and set up search indexing on the institutions behalf and results in the institution relying on paying the third party to keep access to their own data.

With prolly tree based p2p databases we can begin to build up search indexes collaboratively with community members, where individuals or smaller groups can participate in generating indexed data, and larger indexes being formed from combining the smaller ones. For example, cultural institutions can start tracking data for use by their community, and they can also build bridges to other institutions in order to search through larger amounts of data without needing to delegate authority and ownership to a third party like Google.

This can apply outside of cultural institutions as well and can be used for curated search indexes for all sorts of use cases. Communities interested in a given topic can collaborate on search via prolly trees, scientific publishers and communities can combine their data, etc. Instead of having a centralized search engine like Google or Bing which is vulnerable to spam originating from untrusted and illrelevant parties, we can have smaller scale and more focused search indexes wich can be use and combined together based on who is interested in what. This is some of the paths that we're hoping to explore with the IPFS Search team by taking their existing indexed data and finding ways to ingest it into prolly trees and perform searches over top.


Use Cases4:Big Data. Ingtroducing prolly tree based p2p databases into the mix gives us new ways of approaching big data. In the first place it gives us a new way to scale out and shard large datasets accross multiple storage backends by storing subsets of a prolly tree accross several machines. Decoupling the storage from the authoring and reading layer can make it possible to spin up different components within a single cloud or accross people's home machines. Ingestion can be completely changed too in that instead of running ingestion on a single database or via some sort of map reduce cluster, one can split up sections of data to be ingested and indexed and combine the outputted prolly trees at a different layer accross many worker nodes.

Apart from scaling we can now have new ways of structuring data marketplaces where authors of datasets can encrypt prolly trees and sell decryption keys to others which can then process and refine the data and publish it themselves. This sale and publishing can either be done via centralized marketplaces, blockchains, or manually coordinated contracts accross organiations. In fact, having the underlying distribution and processing be decentralized can be a boon to making Data DAOs which manage and profit off of datasets.

"Filecoin Supply Simulation","The Filecoin CryptoEconomics Explorers are web-apps that simulate a digital twin of the Filecoin economy, enabling users to forecast Filecoin circulating supply components such as minting, vesting, locking, and burning, and estimate derived quantities such as FoFR, and rational strategies. Through adjustable parameters like Raw-Byte Onboarding Rate, Renewal Rate, and FIL+ Rate, the apps allow users to explore how changes in storage provider behavior affect these outputs.  ","https://mechafil-jax-web-levers.streamlit.app/ , https://filspcostexplorer.streamlit.app/Cost_Breakdown","Who is this project for?
- This project is for all participants of the Filecoin network who are interested in understanding how the network may evolve.  This includes storage providers, ecosystem participants, and the core-dev community who need to evaluate the effect of new FIP proposals on the Filecoin economy.
What pain points does it solve?
- Due to the complexity of Filecoin’s cryptoeconomics, specialized analysis is often needed to understand the effect of a particular FIP.  For example, to understand the impact of giving all SPs a 10x multiplier regardless of the type of storage the network stores, one needs to model the Fil-on-Fil returns profile of different storage providers given some information about onboarding trends.
- Our tools provide the analysis to do this and communicate the results to the community in an interactive manner, enabling them to reach their conclusions with quantitative backing.  
- Because the governance of Filecoin is based on “soft consensus,” communication of critical results in an interactive manner enables participants to explore and engage with new FIPs, something that was previously unavailable, enabling them to reach a consensus on the best path forward for the network more effectively.
What are the tangible benefits of this contribution?
- Tangible benefits of this contribution include web-applications that the community can access at any time of their choosing to forecast the Filecoin economy’s trajectory, enabling them to make complex business decisions that were previously not possible.

FilOz also focuses on expanding contributor diversity, enhancing security and quality, and resolving complex bugs.","https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors","builtin-actors and ref-fvm are unique components of the Filecoin stack that are used by all current implementations (Lotus, Forest and Venus) to execute its messages. By nature, compiled releases of builtin-actors must be used by all implementations in order to be compatible. Likewise, ref-fvm is the executor engine component that currently has no alternative. Maintenance and careful handling of these components and their release lifecycle is critical to the security, stability and evolution of Filecoin.

* Security: as singular linchpins of the Filecoin stack, it is critical that the code and dependency supply chains be managed carefully so as to avoid the injection of insecure
* Stability: the chain _must_ keep executing, messages _must_ be processed, WindowPoST _must_ be handled. Nowhere else in the Filecoin stack is more ongoing effort applied to ensuring the utmost code quality than in these two components.
* Evolution: Filecoin must grow, change and adapt. Adding new features and retiring old ones. These components are where the bulk of this work happens for the Filecoin L1 and FilOz bears responsibility for executing and assisting others to execute on this evolution.

Expanding the contributor base of these key Filecoin dependencies is a core goal of FilOz. During the period in question FilOz has implemented 8 FIPs, 3 by working alongside three separate parties in learning and contributing. 9 separate members of the FilOz team have contributed directly to writing code, reviewing, assisting the learning journey of third-parties, and shipping releases.","Testimonials are difficult to gather for these internal and ubiquitous Filecoin components.

"Network Health Dashboard","Starboard’s Network Health Dashboard provides the Filecoin ecosystem with digestible, rigorous and informative breakdowns of the Filecoin protocol at the chain, token and service levels. We aggregate data from granular level up to distill insights into the state of the Filecoin network, aiding informed governance and decision-making in the Filecoin ecosystem. 
","https://dashboard.starboard.ventures","Storage providers need to rigorously calculate initial and ongoing costs and/or ROI of onboarding storage on the network. Blockchain analytics teams want to disseminate digestible and accurate metrics to the general public. Product and business development teams in the Filecoin ecosystem need to monitor the uptake of new network initiatives on Filecoin, consequences of network upgrades, etc. Finally, multiple stakeholders involved in the collective governance of Filecoin need access to rigorous information about the network’s trajectory over time in order to make informed decisions about the future directions of the protocol.

All of these needs have a common pain point: each stakeholder depends on the availability of distilled information that is either difficult to access or non-trivial to calculate. Starboard’s Dashboards address these issues by calculating metrics important to our stakeholders from first principles.

Pain points
* Governance team
    * Product and governance teams in the Filecoin ecosystem strongly desire macroscopic metrics about network health and trajectory to make informed decisions
* Research and analytics team
    * Desire fully indexed chain data to conduct research and disseminate important information to the general public
Startups
    * Desire availability of on-chain information to make well-informed decisions

Benefits
* By calculating critical network indicators such as deals per day, storage power onboarding over different levels of aggregation, governance teams are able to understand driving factors for changes in the network health and trajectory
* Accurate and distilled information provides both analytics firms and the general public with fresh intuition and insight into Filecoin’s state

"Helia","Helia, a modular TypeScript implementation of IPFS, supports verifiable data retrieval from storage providers like Filecoin SPs in both NodeJS and browser environments. Features like verified-fetch and service-worker-gateway allow users to pull IPFS content in browser-friendly ways and is leading the way towards enabling a more native IPFS browser experience.","https://ipshipyard.com","Javascript and TypeScript continue to be among the most widely used programming languages particularly on the Web Platform which is the most dominant platform for software distribution today. Having the tools to enable a native IPFS experience on the web without requiring pre-installed external tools is a major part in how we can grow the ecosystem and bring the native benefits of IPFS and Filecoin to users more easily. Additionally, being accessible to JS and TS developers makes it easier to attract developers to the ecosystem that will build dApps and other applications on top of IPFS and Filecoin.

Just a single major benefit here is that the ecosystem currently relies heavily on major public gateways like ipfs.io and dweb.link to render their data which is both an unfortunate centralization and cost center for a distributed network to bear. Helia enables the building out of tools like inbrowser.link and Helia’s verified-fetch which are in development with the goal of being able to ultimately replace a huge amount of centralized gateway usage with a more resilient, cost effective, and decentralized alternative.","N/A","TOOLING","[{""description"":""Annoucing Helia's verified-fetch module"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://blog.ipfs.tech/verified-fetch/""},{""description"":""The state of dApps on IPFS"",""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://blog.ipfs.tech/dapps-ipfs/""}]","https://github.com/ipfs/helia","{""TOOLING"":{""osoName"":""https://www.opensource.observer/artifacts/github/ipfs/helia"",""dependentProjects"":""It enables people to interact with IPFS content which is a major source of usage of the Filecoin network.

The most obvious of these is js-libp2p the majority of which is developed by the Helia developers (and which has not applied as a separate application to this round).\n\nOne of Filecoin’s selling points is in being able to improve applications via p2p tooling at both the storage layer (i.e. resilient and decentralized verifiable storage) and the blockchain layer (i.e. resilient and decentralized verifiable database and execution layer). Ultimately, we need the kinds of improvements driven by Helia to make more of Filecoin's unique capabilities usable within the web platform (the most widely deployed application platform) instead of being stuck for compatibility reasons with combining the brittleness of web2 infrastructure with complexity and newness of web3 infrastructure.""}}"
"ETHGlobal","At ETHGlobal, we're leveraging our years of experience to foster a world-class ecosystem of Ethereum developers and entrepreneurs. ETHGlobal has been one of the principal forums for developer education and experimentation on the FVM + Filecoin.","https://ethglobal.com/","ETHGlobal contributes directly to the education of the FVM & Filecoin ecosystem via developer engagement at conferences and in-person and online hackathons we organize. Our events are the principal forum for developer education, tinkering, and direct DevEx feedback for the FIL/FVM teams.

"Consensus Pledge design flaw fix","A protocol audit identified a design flaw in the Initial Pledge mechanism. Unchecked, this was expected to lead to exponentially declining collateral. Collateral is essential because it backs consensus security; without it, the budget to attack the protocol is small. The proposed backstop, which has been accepted as a FIP, ensures that the consensus pledge has a component that does not exponentially decline to 0 when the network’s quality-adjusted power (QAP) is below the baseline function, making the protocol much less vulnerable to 33% adversarial control of consensus power.","https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/847","Who is this project for?
- This project impacts every participant in the Filecoin network. Everyone depends on the network’s consensus security to conduct daily business, such as proving storage and making payments - without this fix, that would have been threatened due to the network’s QAP crossing the baseline function from above.
- Network participants that this affects includes storage providers, token holders, ecosystem partners, secondary partners that may rely on the Filecoin chain for their own apps, and new startups that are building on top of the Filecoin network.

What pain points does it solve?
- This contribution solves the problem of weakening network consensus security due to a design flaw in the original protocol design. 

What are the tangible benefits of this contribution?
- The tangible benefits are: 1) CryptoEcon research publication on the pledge mechanism and why the current protocol is in danger of a 33% attack and 2) updated builtin-actors codebase to include baseline bug fix.  Both of these results in the network being more secure.

Real Paid Storage Solutions: Collaborations with organizations such as the Senior Support Society drive real paid storage adoption in Australia, promoting and expanding awareness of Filecoin’s real paid storage solutions among enterprises and institutions, thereby strengthening Filecoin’s presence in the data storage market.
NFT-Based Financial Solutions:

The introduction of an NFT Launchpad within the FVM ecosystem adds a new layer of functionality. By allowing projects to use NFTs as collateral, users can stake their NFTs to earn project tokens. This innovation provides projects with new fundraising mechanisms while offering NFT holders opportunities to leverage their assets, thus driving more engagement and investment in the FVM ecosystem.
Simplified Project Financing and Ownership Verification:

The OpenGate Launchpad allows FVM projects to raise funds by issuing project NFTs. This approach not only streamlines the fundraising process but also ensures that user rights are confirmed and can be traded on OpenGate's secondary market. This added liquidity transforms traditional equity into tradable assets, encouraging investment and participation in the ecosystem.
For project developers, this reduces barriers to entry by providing a flexible and transparent way to access funding, while users benefit from greater assurance and the ability to trade their assets, increasing the overall economic activity within the ecosystem.","Twitter followers 40K+

Special events:
Especially after the incident in April 2024 when FEVM's important Defi project STFIL was frozen by the police, we actively participated in the handling of the incident throughout the process, and communicated and interacted with Dannyob and JenksGuo of the Filecoin Foundation, and worked together to resolve the incident to reduce the huge negative impact of the STFIL incident on the development of the Filecoin ecosystem.

Highlights:
Actively promote the development of the Filecoin search market, such as: deeply participate in the construction of the Titan project, and continuously promote the development of the Filecoin search market.","Nanshan Jushi started to get involved in the stock market in 2002. He experienced two bull and bear cycles, from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2015, and realized the great charm of the capital market.

In 2013, he co-founded an investment management company and was involved in securities, precious metal spot, agricultural products, cultural and artistic works and other businesses. During this period, he served as a precious metal business trainer and guide for Postal Savings Bank, and has self-media such as Weibo, blogs, and public accounts of ""Nanshan Jutu Leading Stock"".

In 2019, he came into contact with IPFS and Filecoin, and continued to learn about the encryption industry. In order to convey relevant information more objectively and quickly, he founded the ""IPFS and Filecoin Value Information Transmission"" public account and short video content such as YouTube, Kuaishou, and Toutiao.

"Filecoin Spark","The Filecoin Spark protocol measures the retrievability of data stored on Filecoin, and aggregates the results to create an overall retrieval success rate for the whole Filecoin network as well as for individual Storage Providers. This data is then available in the Spark dashboard, on-chain or via the Spark API.

Filecoin Spark data is used by allocators when making datacap allocation decisions. This incentive for SPs has led to an order-of-magnitude improvement in the retrievability of data from Filecoin. The data is also used in other Filecoin related dashboards such as Starboard and the new SP market dashboard.
","https://filspark.com","This project is important for the Filecoin Network because it is focussing on a huge pain point for Filecoin - the retrievability of data. Verifiable retrievability is a massive hurdle that Filecoin needs to solve in order to find product market fit. However, this is a hard problem to solve in the trustless setting. Spark is currently the most advanced initiative in trustless verifiable retrievability.

The retrieval success rate of public data stored on filecoin through the FIL+ program was hovering around 1% when Spark measurements began in April 2024. Since April 2024, and in particular since Spark data started being used by allocators in data cap allocation pathways, Spark has measured a more-than-10x improvement in the retrievability of FIL+ data stored on Filecoin. (https://blog.filstation.app/posts/spark-sees-10x-improvement-in-filecoin-retrievability)

In April 2024, no SPs had a weekly Spark Retrieval Success Rate above 90%. At its high water mark so far in October 2024, 77 SPs had a weekly Spark Retrieval Success Rate above 90%, with a handful of SPs over 99% on the weekly score.

Once clients can be confident of the retrievability/availability as well the durability of data stored on Filecoin, we believe we will see many more customers use Filecoin as their storage layer.




","- Tweet from Storacha CTO about their plans to use Spark for Storacha verifiable retrievability: https://x.com/techgirlwonder/status/1828515789227598325. Any trustless Storage and retrieval network will need something like Spark to verify their retrievability.

This unlocks a new primitive on FVM, payments denominated in USD, enabling participants in Filecoin to hedge risk, manage volatility, and earn dollar-denominated yield.","https://usdfil.xyz","**Who is this project for?**

* Storage Providers
    * All payments on FVM, to date, are denominated in the chain native token, FIL. However, FIL is a volatile currency and with fluctuating values, it is difficult to bill for service revenue and plan expenditure. 
    * USDfil enables SPs to make and receive payments for storage with a dollar denominated currency. This enables SPs to hedge risk and manage volatility directly on FVM, making it easier for them to engage with customers and suppliers.
* Storage Users
    * Similar to Storage providers, storage users can currently only pay for storage on-chain using the FIL token. USDfil enables them to pay for storage with a dollar denominated currency directly on chain.
* Speculators
    * Support Filecoin economy through FIL token usage (FIL backs USDfil) in a neutral setting without taking on additional price risk.
    * Swap in and out of FIL with the click of a button directly on FVM
* Economy at large
    * USDfil generates a dollar denominated yield. This is in contrast to other DeFI protocols currently on chain, such as REPL and GLIF, which both generate FIL denominated yield. Users can only gain access to this yield if they buy FIL and deposit it into the USDfil smart contract. Therefore, USDfil’s yield creates a new use-case for buying the FIL token.
    * Increase FIL token usage in a neutral setting without taking on additional price risk. Holding the USDfil token gives USD exposure natively on FVM, but still uses FI, as USDfil is collateralized with FIL. This has the potential to increase the velocity of the FIL token, driving overall value to Filecoin.
* Investors & Grant Providers
    * Funders can send payments denominated in USD directly on-chain to their intended recipients. 
    * For example, USDfil enables the Filecoin Foundation to make payments to grant recipients denominated in USD, directly on chain.  Investors can use this same paradigm to invest in storage provider operations.

**What pain points does it solve?**

The primary pain point that USDfil solves is that there currently is no way to conduct transactions on-chain denominated in a stable currency. The only way to do on-chain transactions is through the FIL token, which is volatile. USDfil solves this problem.

**What are the tangible benefits of this contribution?**

The downstream effects of USDfil are as follows:

* Hedging against FIL volatility - storage providers and users need to make consistent payments or manage cash flows on FVM without worrying about FIL’s price swings. USDfil provides financial stability to Filecoin network participants, enabling them to plan long-term without worrying about speculative price risks.
* Denominating payments in USD on FVM broadens the ecosystem and encourages new participants to entire, who may previously have been hesitant to do so because of the lack of a stable payment mechanism.
* Dollar denominated yield - speculators may choose to get into the FIL ecosystem due to high Fil-on-FIL returns offered by GLIF and REPL. However, yield is still denominated in FIL, meaning that it is still subject to the same price-swings.  Enabling FIL holders to gain access to yield denominated in USD can encourage new participants to enter the FIL ecosystem.
* Versatility and Financial Flexibility - Having liquid and flexible financial markets is a critical component of any well functioning economy. USDfil enables this and therefore adds a layer of versatility to the Filecoin economy that was previously non-existent.","N/A","END_USER_EXPERIENCE","[{""description"":""USDfil App Website"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://usdfil.xyz""},{""description"":""USDfil GitHub Repo"",""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/usdfil""},{""description"":""Stablecoin Review Article"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/0x597217F6e5573F102f8389908c7667A75B7C32a9/bvkCEu1Qc8e6kiovlKsfP_yEDNtH2CyPzhrFXe2hrTk""},{""description"":""USDfil: The First Stablecoin on FVM"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/0x597217F6e5573F102f8389908c7667A75B7C32a9/jUPAUJlAKK8CGu7tZILdI776zH6D4N8ds4qKGZyjA1A""}]","https://github.com/usdfil","{""END_USER_EXPERIENCE"":{""caseStudies"":"""",""walletInteractions"":""* Mainnet contract live on date 15-August-2024.\n* User Statistics\n    * From 15-Aug to 1 Nov, we have gone from 0 - 35 users.  \n    * This represents a month-on-month growth rate of 314%\n    * We expect 1000-2000 users in year 1."",""userRetention"":""The protocol is not able to track retention of users directly.

"JZFS","A Git-like version control file system for Datasets Management in the Era of AI.","https://gitdata.ai","Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data are the three categories of data sources that can be classified. Unstructured data account for approximately 80% of all global data, whereas structured data account for only 20%.

As models have become more sophisticated and pushbutton, AI teams have realized that focusing on data iteration is just as important, if not more so, for developing and deploying high-accuracy models successfully and efficiently. ML models have become increasingly complicated and opaque in recent years, necessitating significantly larger amounts of training data. In addition, data have evolved into a useful interface for working with subject matter experts and transforming their expertise into software. Finally, data-centric AI enables a higher level of model accuracy than was previously feasible using only model centric techniques.

Datasets are dynamic.  New files and new versions of existing files enter the datasets at the ingestion stage.  Additionally, extractors can evolve over time and generate new versions of raw data.  As a result, datasets versioning is a cross-cutting concern across all stages of a datasets.  Of course vanilla distributed file systems are not adequate for versioning-related operations.  For example, simply storing all versions may be too costly for large datasets, and without a good version manager, just using filenames to track versions can be error-prone.  In a datasets, for which there are usually many users, it is even more important to clearly maintain correct versions being used and evolving across different users.  Furthermore, as the number of versions increases, efficiently and cost-effectively providing storage and retrieval of versions is going to be an important feature of a successful datasets system.

JZFS was born as a solution for the above problems.

JZFS is an industry-leading Data-Centric Version Control File System, helps ensure Responsible AI Engineering by improving Data Versioning, Provenance, and Reproducibility.

In production systems with machine learning components, updates and experiments are frequent. New updates to models(data products) may be released every day or every few minutes, and different users may see the results of different models as part of A/B experiments or canary releases.

- Version Everything: Data scientists are often criticized for being less disciplined with versioning their experiments(versioning of data, pipeline, code, and models), especially when using computational notebooks.
- Track Data Provenance: This applies to all processing steps in an AI/ML pipeline, including data collection/acquisition, data merging, data cleaning, feature extraction, learning, or deployment.
- Reproducibility: A final question of AI/ML that is often relevant for debugging, audits, and also science more broadly is to what degree data, models, and decisions can be reproduced.

"go-graphsplit","Go-Graphsplit is a powerful tool designed to efficiently partition large datasets into manageable graph slices, facilitating deal-making in the Filecoin Network. By leveraging advanced data structures and protocols, Go-Graphsplit offers a solution that not only enhances storage efficiency but also improves data retrieval processes. ","https://github.com/filedrive-team/go-graphsplit","Go-Graphsplit divides large datasets into smaller pieces that fit the sector sizes of 32GiB or 64GiB, optimizing storage deals with miners. This process allows for storing substantial amounts of data, potentially reaching hundreds of TiB in a month. Traditional methods require retrieving and decompressing entire tarballs to access a single file, causing inefficiencies. Graphsplit addresses this by cutting datasets into smaller graphs using the IPLD protocol and Unixfs format. This approach maintains the original file system structure as much as possible, enabling efficient retrieval of individual files using payload CIDs through the Lotus client.Graphsplit generates a manifest.csv file that records the mapping between graph slice names, payload CIDs, piece CIDs, and the internal file structure. This ensures transparency and ease of access to stored data.
In the past serveral months, Go-Graphsplit enhances the Filecoin Network's operational efficiency by streamlining both storage and retrieval processes.

"Energy Validation Process & Green Scores Methodology","The Energy Validation Process (EVP) and Green Scores Methodology represent an effort to incentivize and recognize sustainability within the Filecoin ecosystem. Through a rigorous auditing and validation process, and comprehensive scoring system, these initiatives empower Storage Providers (SPs) to quantify and improve their environmental impact, while also fostering a culture of environmental responsibility across the network.","https://novaenergy.ai","Impact:

Validation and Recognition: The EVP offers SPs a pathway to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability through data-driven validation. By submitting detailed information on energy consumption, production, and eco-conscious practices, SPs not only receive recognition in the form of an audit output and sustainability claim but also pave the way for possible economic incentives tied to their Green Scores.

Holistic Impact Assessment: The Green Scores Methodology goes beyond simplistic metrics to provide a nuanced evaluation of SP’s environmental impact. By considering factors such as emissions intensity, location-specific effects on the power grid, and data integrity, this methodology offers a comprehensive assessment that reflects the complex realities of sustainable data storage and Storage Provider operations.

Incentivizing Sustainability: In the future, we intend to tie Green Scores to economic benefits, such as reputation score boosts and access to green financing opportunities, which will enable the EVP and Green Scores Methodology to incentivize SPs to prioritize sustainability. This will not only benefit individual SPs but also contribute to the broader goal of reducing the environmental impact and advancing Filecoin's commitment to a greener future.

Why It Matters:

In an era defined by growing environmental awareness and urgency, initiatives like the EVP and Green Scores Methodology play a crucial role in driving sustainable innovation within the Filecoin ecosystem. By empowering SPs to quantify and improve their environmental impact, while also fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, these projects exemplify the potential of blockchain technology to address pressing global challenges.","The tangible benefits of this contribution include:

- A standardized, comprehensive methodology (Green Scores) for assessing environmental impact.
- A rigorous auditing and validation process (EVP) that provides credibility to sustainability claims.
- Future economic incentives tied to sustainability performance.
- Increased transparency and accountability in the Filecoin network.
- Potential for reputation score boosts and access to green financing opportunities for SPs.
- Advancement towards reducing the overall environmental impact of the Filecoin network.

They hold bi-weekly calls to share updates, discuss protocol (FIP) and client implementation needs and priorities from the Filecoin community and ecosystem, review bug bounties, align on FIP development, and coordinate network upgrades. Members of the WG have shipped 2 network upgrades with >10 FIPs during this review period, including but not limiting  DDO, actor events, BLS syscall and etc,  and are marching towards an n24 Nov upgrade with 3 FIPs along with other enhancements and implementation releases. Lotus and Forest teams are also actively aligning and developing API spec and improve eth APIs to support networks rpc provider, tooling and builder needs.

It creates an important communication bridge for network' protocol implementation teams and the teams creating core dependencies that these implementations use (e.g., proofs).
The working group is a forcing function to pay attention to and be mindful of what other implementation teams are up to, and solves the pain points of getting alignment and collaboration decisions made quicker towards network's upgrade trajectory and base blockchain capability needs.  
When at its best, the working group causes teams to look at the bigger picture and see how they can coordinate with the larger network of teams to deliver network-wide changes.  For example, with NI PoRep, one team did the research and protocol design work and write the the FIP, another did the early prototype, and another took on the shared conformance test suite.

"FILLiquid","FILLiquid is a decentralized Filecoin-based lending platform that aims to facilitate continuous storage power growth. We aim to enhance the Filecoin ecosystem by enabling $FIL holders to generate returns on their assets through our secure, decentralized, open-sourced, and audited leasing ecosystem. Simultaneously, storage providers can utilize $FIL previously pledged within their nodes as security for leasing $FIL to increase storage capacity.

Alongside FIL lending, FILLiquid offers FIG (native token) farming and revenue-sharing through its FIG staking protocol, allowing native token holders to become protocol owners.","https://filliquid.io/","FILLiquid’s impact will help secure the sustainable growth of the Filecoin storage capacity, allowing it to continue competing with the heavyweight centralized storage markets, such as Amazon W3. The project is important for both storage providers and FIL holders, allowing the former to acquire FIL for pledging and the latter to earn yield on holdings.

FILLiquid is designed to ease the financial burdens of storage providers. Every time an SP intends to expand their services, they're required to pledge more FIL, leading to increased financial pressure. The pledging requirements for Filecoin storage providers present an opportunity cost between using funds for expanding storage hardware or obtaining $FIL to expand storage capacity. 

Our solution allows storage providers to achieve both. They can use their liquid funds to buy hardware to expand their business capacity while using the previously pledged illiquid $FIL in their nodes as collateral to secure more $FIL to add more pledges and expand storage power.

This impact eases the financial burden for storage providers, expands storage power growth, and lets $FIL holders earn a yield.

With AI systems presenting an ever-growing market for decentralized data storage services, Filecoin can be the leading provider as long as it can keep pace with AI models' expansive storage capacity needs. FILLiquid can do its part in keeping pace with AI data requirements by aiding continuous storage power expansion.

In addition to storage power expansion, FILLiquid also presents unique routes to generating yield. For example, the platform offers a revenue-sharing opportunity for native token holders (FIG) to stake and earn a portion of the revenues generated on the platform through transactions.

Overall, FILLiquid deepens the $FIL liquid available to storage providers, helping Filecoin to experience consistent and sustainable storage power growth over time.

As of September 30, FILLiquid has contributed significantly to growing the Filecoin economy, both in terms of user engagement and lending support to storage providers (SPs), which is essential for the ecosystem’s growth. Here’s an overview based on key metrics:

User Engagement and Wallet Growth: With 3,400 pledged wallet addresses, FILLiquid has encouraged widespread adoption, creating a strong user base actively participating in staking and lending. This level of engagement strengthens the network by promoting a reliable base of participants.

Deposits and Lending:

User Deposits: FILLiquid has accrued a substantial total of 417,759 FIL in user deposits, showing significant trust and investment in the platform by users.
SP Loans: A total of 137,628 FIL has been loaned to storage providers. This financial support directly enhances the Filecoin network by allowing SPs to expand their storage capacities, creating a more robust and scalable network.
Community Growth:

Twitter: 56,138 followers
Discord: 22,607 members
YouTube: 1,240 followers
Medium Blogspot: 11,000 Claps, 51163 Views
AMA, X Space, Binance Live: 100k>  Tuned in/Watched

The following is the impact that FILLiquid generated.

These numbers reflect a growing community, crucial for educating, engaging, and retaining users while promoting Filecoin's long-term ecosystem growth.

FILLiquid’s direct economic impact can be seen in both the large amount of FIL deposits and the substantial FIL loans provided to SPs. This facilitates more decentralized storage and supports the network’s stability and scalability.","FIL Retro- PGF 1 https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-1-results-7e5a0bcdba08 May 22, 2024

"Glif Nodes & RPC API service","The Glif Node Team has supported and widely contributed to the majority of the Filecoin ecosystem, becoming one of the most reliable and trustworthy RPC provider partners of the Filecoin Team since before the Mainnet. 
By having support from RetroPGF-1 we were able to focus on delivering new powerful features - The Graph (subgraphs) support, RPC method usage statistics & analysis, simplified access to archive nodes and granular control over access tokens.","https://api.node.glif.io","# Improvements and new features over the last 3 months
## Data availability: The Graph support
📊 Glif Nodes started to offer subgraphs indexation to anyone who might need quick access to the historical blockchain data for their dApps, analytics, etc. We already indexed the subgraphs of the Uniswap, Sushiswap and Secured Finance for the public usage.

❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: Imagine trying to find specific chapters in a book with millions of pages—this would take a lot of time without a proper index to guide you. Glif Nodes offers a service that acts like an organized index for the blockchain. This helps anyone who needs quick access to historical data: past transactions or information on dApps. By having this “index” ready, developers and analysts can find what they need instantly without searching through the entire “book” of blockchain data.
🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: dApps, analysts, ecosystem in general
📈 Key Metrics: 8 subgraphs indexed, over 700,000 entities indexed
📋 Proof of Work: [https://monitoring.node.glif.io/d/d5024e54-95c1-46fa-8057-f5627a6ec883/big-and-pretty-stats-dashboard](Grafana Dashboards)

## RPC method usage statistics & analysis
📈 Glif Nodes offers its users the convenient way to understand their current usage for every key they have created to better analyze & optimize their code
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? We are providing a tool that works like a detailed report for developers. Just like how a report cards shows which subjects you’re excelling in or where you need to improve, Glif Nodes offers usage statistics for each key a user has created. This allows developers to see how efficiently their code is working when it comes to querying the nodes, and make adjustments to improve performance, helping them “optimize” their work and avoid unnecessary problems.
🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: our current and new users
📋 Proof of Work:  [https://api.node.glif.io/](RPC/Analytics tab)

## Simplified access to archive nodes
📈 Glif Nodes started to offer a posibility to request access to the archival node online without the need to fill the form and long-wait for pre-approval.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? User gets access to the history data calls faster
🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: our current and new users
📋 Proof of Work:  [https://api.node.glif.io/](Request new key on Proteus Shield)

## Batch request support
📈 Batch requests are a feature of the Ethereum JSON-RPC API that allows multiple requests to be sent in a single HTTP POST request. Batch requests can be useful for reducing network latency and improving application performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests that need to be sent and processed.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Glif Nodes simplifes a ""bureaucracy"". Imagine a library, where if you need a book you need to fill a request form. If you need multiple books though - it becomes a problem as you will have to fill multiple forms. With ""batch requests"" support - you fill one form where you specify every book you need one by one thus simplifying access to the library. 
🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: our current and new users
📋 Proof of Work:  [https://api.node.glif.io/](Send the request to the node)

## Granular control over access tokens
📈 As the usage increase, it becomes more and more important for our users to be able to secure the tokens they use to access our nodes. We added more granular control for the API key allowing to limit the sources of the API requests (per IP address), the number of requests per day per key and allowed to share certain keys with other users, which might be useful in a case of distributed workloads.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Imagine you have a prepaid card that others can use to access a service, but every time they use it, it costs you money. You’d want to make sure they only use it when necessary and not too often. Glif Nodes gives you control over this by allowing you to set limits on who can use your “card” and how many times they can use it in a day.

*Below you will find information about the ongoing support, contribution and services we are providing for the Filecoin Ecosystem on the regular basis.*

# Project Contributions
As the Glif Nodes, we contributed to core pillars of the Filecoin Network, including:

🌐Data Availability (API[1](#api), CID Checker[2](#cid-checker), Bootstrap nodes[3](#bootstrap-nodes), MarketDeals[4](#statemarketdeals-data)) 🦸‍♂️Ecosystem user support [5](#user-support) and 🛠️Developer tooling crafting[6](#developer-tooling) (Docker images, IaC, Helm Charts)

# Project impact
## API
🌐 Glif Nodes offers publicly available API service that had 100% availability over the last 3 months (the only downtime we had was when the whole network went down for a few hours), with over 230,000 unique IP addresses currently sending around 1 billion requests per month.

❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify:
It is a service similar to a highly reliable public library that's open almost all the time—virtually 24/7—where over 230,000 people from different places visit monthly.

Imagine each visitor using the library more than once, amounting to 1 billion requests for books every month.

Just as a library serves its community by providing free access to knowledge, Glif API nodes provide crucial data and services to users of the Filecoin network. Glif nodes' near-perfect availability ensures that anyone relying Filecoin's digital 'library' can access the information they need anytime, without interruptions, making Glif service a dependable and essential resource for the community.

🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Filecoin Network users who want to e.g. make the transactions or connect the Metamask; dApps; The Filecoin Core Team, Filecoin Station. All those groups use the nodes that we are running.

📈 Key Metrics: ~1 billion requests every month from 230k different IPs, 100% of availability.

📋 Proof of Work: https://monitoring.node.glif.io/public-dashboards/6eab5f7a31fa4eebb27b6c23c53e9afe https://status.node.glif.io/

## CID Checker
✅ Glif Node provides a CID Checker - a tool to check any CID in the network.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: CID Checker works much like a tracking system for packages. In the digital world of the Filecoin network, where files and information are sent and stored across a decentralized system, each piece of content is given a unique label, known as a CID (Content Identifier).

This label helps to track and locate specific pieces of content within the network, just like a postal tracking number allows you to see where your package is and when it will arrive. The CID Checker allows anyone to enter this unique label and find out where the content is stored and how it can be accessed. It's a user-friendly tool that ensures transparency and accessibility, helping users feel confident and informed about where their data is held in the vast digital space.

📋 Proof of Work: https://cid.filecoin.tools

## Bootstrap nodes
📶 Glif Nodes offers the service of bootstrap nodes for Filecoin Mainnet and testnet (aka Calibnet).
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: Just as the main pillars of a bridge ensure it stays upright and usable, bootstrap nodes act as foundational and primary connecting points that allows new node runners to discover and connect to other nodes in the network, making this contribution a public good essential to the network’s health and functionality.

🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Developers who build new projects and need to run their own node; miners within the network; users who simply want to run RPC nodes.

📈 Key Metrics: 2000+ nodes connected to our bootstrap node, which indicates that most of those users started their nodes with our service.

## StateMarketDeals data
📊 Glif Nodes creates comprehensive reports (StateMarketDeal dumps) that track the performance and activities within the Filecoin market. These reports are widely utilized by community members, including groups focused on maintaining network reputation (Reputation DAO) and various tools designed to analyze Filecoin data (FIL plus toolings, Filecoin data metric toolings, etc.).
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: Think of it as providing an accounting book that is used to perform health check-ups for the network, ensuring it operates smoothly and reliably, which is essential for anyone relying on this digital space to store or access their important information.

🧑‍💻 Who is the end user that benefits from the project: Community members, including groups focused on maintaining network reputation (Reputation DAO) and various tools designed to analyze Filecoin data (FIL plus toolings, Filecoin data metric toolings, etc.).

📈 Key Metrics: https://github.com/data-preservation-programs/RetrievalBot/blob/main/integration%2Fstatemarketdeals%2Fmain.go#L67

## User support
🦸‍♂️ The Glif Nodes Team provides support to the ecosystem, users, core development teams and integrators.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify: The Glif Nodes Team acts like a supportive neighbor in the community of the Filecoin network. Just as good neighbors help each other out, we offer timely community and partner support to various groups and projects within the ecosystem, encouraging its growth and development.

## Developer tooling
🛠️ Glif Nodes supplies several essential software components for developers in a ready-to-use form - Docker images, Infrastructure-as-Code tool and Helm charts.
❓ Troubles with understanding all that geek talk? Let’s simplify:

We supply several essential software components for developers much like how a pre-assembled furniture kit makes it easy to set up a bookshelf without needing to understand carpentry. These software 'kits' help various organizations within the Filecoin network easily build and manage their systems, enhancing efficiency and accessibility.

📋 Examples of such services delivered by Glif Nodes to Filecoin community are:
a) Filecoin Docker images that are nowadays just as popular as the Docker images supported by the Filecoin core team; they help developers to quickly spin up their own nodes on the Filecoin network. Devs just need to download the image and run it. 
b) The Filecoin-IaC tool that allows reducing efforts for users who are willing to spin up thousands of Filecoin nodes. Without the tool they would have to repeat this process thousand times scaling the process 
c) The Filecoin-chart tool that does same thing as Filecoin-IaC but over Kubernetes","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aBsxO5Pns7UIHJq32BiV2fCxzuviCUvO/view?usp=sharing","INFRASTRUCTURE","[{""description"":""Infrastructure as Code repo"",""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/glifio/filecoin-iac""},{""description"":""Grafana Monitoring"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://monitoring.node.glif.io/d/d5024e54-95c1-46fa-8057-f5627a6ec883/big-and-pretty-stats-dashboard?orgId=1""},{""description"":""Uptime statistics"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://status.node.glif.io""},{""description"":""Protues Shield (aka Glif Nodes website)"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://api.node.glif.io""},{""description"":""Glif Nodes Docker Images"",""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://hub.docker.com/r/glif/lotus""}]","https://github.com/glifio/filecoin-iac","{""INFRASTRUCTURE"":{""osoName"":""glifio"",""topProjects"":""High-impact projects, such as Filecoin Station, FilOz, Glif Services and others depends on our API and other services, rather than on our repositories, which are mostly used for internal purpose."",""filecoinUsers"":""Based on analytics provided on [Filecoin.io website](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/2023-expanding-from-a-storage-network-to-enabling-open-services-for-data-part-i/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202023%2C%20200,power%20an%20open%20data%20economy.) and comparing it with 300,000 unique IPs querying our endpoints monthly we are estimating to be used by at least 50% of the network.

"IPFS VS Code Extension","The VS Code Extension for IPFS provides an integrated way for developer to get started on IPFS protocol. 

Without leaving the Visual Studio Code IDE interface, the extension allows a local IPFS node to be installed, spun up and provide the user interfaces for almost all of the IPFS node operations. Rather than providing an light http/api integrations, the extension goes further to scan for the latest binaries of IPFS node implementation, download them based on the operating system, then run it from the contained VS code development environment, exposes web api and web pages for developer to interact with. 

The features include: 
- Start & stop IPFS node daemon
- Show node information & peers information in the sidebar (refresh every 5s)
- Upload files & folders from explorer and the sidebar
- List files & folders in IPFS node and allow pinning and unpinning of files
- Show IPFS Web UI in VS Code WebView
- View IPFS file content via VS Code WebView
- CID syntax highlight and tooltip information

As you can see from the gif animation on our github page, the tool not only allow files & folders to be uploaded to IPFS, a preview of them, a terminal to show IPFS activities, but also allows interactions such as pinning, unpinning, shutting and turning node on.

"GovXS – Evaluating Retro Funding Voting Designs","FIL RetroPGF requires robust, intelligent voting mechanisms. GovXS, a research project initiated by [Token Engineering Academy](https://x.com/tokengineering) and kicked off by Optimism, has analyzed widely used Retro Funding voting rules. These included Quadratic Voting, Quorum Median, Capped Median, and the Mean rule, which was used in Filecoin RetroPGF Round 1. Through detailed axiomatic analysis and agent-based simulations, we found critical flaws in each rule. Our study offers alternative designs to improve voting integrity. GovXS provides actionable insights for Filecoin’s RetroPGF, enabling fairer outcomes and strengthening the ecosystem.","https://mirror.xyz/0x803860D2C333734cD99625d8d189d0Eb2e565166 ","This project is important for the Filecoin ecosystem, particularly for community members, contributors, and decision-makers involved in the RetroPGF program. It’s also valuable to the broader crypto community, academic researchers, and public goods funding advocates who seek fair, transparent, and reliable governance models.

GovXS’s research has uncovered major flaws in the voting systems used in Filecoin RetroPGF Round 1 and similar Retro Funding programs. The commonly used Quadratic Voting, Mean Rule, Quorum Median, and Capped Median designs are not strategy-proof, meaning voters can **improve their outcome by misrepresenting their preferences**.

Our solution addresses three key issues in Retro Funding:
1) Ensuring project participation by providing a fair evaluation and compensation system, attracting top projects.
2) Encouraging voter participation by enforcing a voter code of conduct, preventing wasted time on a flawed system.
3) Upholding Retro Funding’s legitimacy by ensuring fair, trustworthy votes are cast.

The tangible benefits of this contribution:
1) Fairer Funding Allocations: GovXS improves RetroPGF voting designs, making fund distributions more aligned with true project impact.
